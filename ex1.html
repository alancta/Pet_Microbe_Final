            <h2>EXPERIMENT 1</h2>
            <p>
              For this experiment, I wanted to find out what kind of temperature
              my microbe will thrive in, and wanted to find out whether it would
              be able to grow in extreme colds.

            <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>
              My microbe will not grow in sub-zero temperatures.
            </p>
            <h3>Description of experiment</h3>
            <p>
              For this experiment, I placed one sample of my microbe in the
              freezer, where it was exposed to a temperature of -16째 C, and kept
              in the dark. Then, I placed another sample of my microbe in a
              drawer of my room (so that it was not exposed to light), where the
              temperature was 21째 C. I made sure both the samples were not
              exposed to light, to keep the experiment consistent -- since
              temperature is the environmental variable I will be changing. I
              then observed the growth of my microbe for 5 days and recorded the
              results.
            </p>
            <h3>Results</h3>
            <h3>Treatment Group 1(Frozen at -16째 C)</h3>
            <img src="images/frozen_collage.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              There was no increase in size.
            </p>
            <h3>Treatment Group 2(Room temperature, 21째 C)</h3>

            <img src="images/room_temp_collage.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              There was a clear increase in size, which means the fungi was
              growing.
            </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                My hypothesis was correct, my microbe could not grow in extreme
                cold temperatures.
              </li>
              <li>
                It thrived in the my room's temperature, which was a cool and
                dark condition.
              </li>
              <li>
                Through this experiment, I have learned that my microbe, Mike
                Robe, enjoys cool environments and cannot grow in extreme cold.
