      <h2>EXPERIMENT 3</h2>
      <p>
        For this experiment, I wanted to find out how Mike Robe would interact with organic matter.

      <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
      <p>
        My microbe will infect the grape.
      </p>
      <h3>Description of experiment</h3>
      <p>
        For this experiment, I placed one sample of my microbe in a petri dish with a grape and kept it at room temperature. For my control, I placed the grape in a petri dish without my microbe. I then placed both petri dishes in a drawer in my room, so that they would not be exposed to any light. I then observed the growth of my microbe for 5 days and recorded the results.
      </p>
      <h3>Results</h3>
      <h3>Treatment Group 1(Plug of microbe placed with grape)</h3>
      <img src="images/grapefun_collage.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        My microbe infected the grape.
      </p>
      <h3>Control Group (Petri dish without grape)</h3>
  
      <img src="images/grape_collage.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        The grape did not show any symptoms of infection
      </p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          My hypothesis was correct, my microbe does infected the grape. The results can be said to be similar to Experiment 2 in the sense that my microbe likes to consume plant nutrients.
        </li>
        <li>
          The control group did not show any signs of infection because it was not exposed to my microbe. 
        </li>
        <li>
          The nutrients in the grape were absorbed by my microbe to grow. 
        </li>
