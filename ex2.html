            <p>
              For this experiment, I wanted to find out what kind of nutrient
              media my fungi will thrive in.

            <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>
              My microbe not grow in Water Agar.
            </p>
            <h3>Description of experiment</h3>
            <p>
              For this experiment, I placed one plug of my microbe in the CV8
              Media, and another in a petri dish filled with Water Agar. I then
              placed them in a drawer in my room to keep them away from light
              (or at least exposing them to light at the same amount of time
              when opening the drawer), I then observed the growth of my microbe
              for 5 days and recorded the results.
            </p>
            <h3>Results</h3>
            <h3>Treatment Group 1(Microbe placed in Water Agar)</h3>
            <img src="images/wa_collage.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              There was no increase in size.
            </p>
            <h3>Treatment Group 2(Microbe placed in CV8)</h3>

            <img src="images/cv8_collage.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              There was a clear increase in size, which means the fungi was
              growing
            </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                My hypothesis was correct, my microbe could not grow in Water
                Agar (WA)and it thrived in CV8 media.
              </li>
              <li>
                I think the reason that it did not grow in WA is because there
                are no nutrients in the media for the fungi to absorb, which
                means no nutrients were supplied to the fungi.
              </li>
              <li>
                It thrived in CV8 media perhaps because CV8 contains a nutrient
                mix derived from different fruits/vegetables, and my fungi could
                absorb the nutrients and grow.
              </li>
              <li>
                Through this experiment, I have learned that my microbe, Mike
                Robe, enjoys nutrients from vegetables and fruits and is able to
                thrive when when these nutrients are provided as a nutrient
                source.
              </li>
