            <h2>EXPERIMENT 4</h2>
            <p>
              For this experiment, I wanted to find out how my microbe would
              interact with bacteria.

            <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>
              The fungi will stop bacteria from growing.
            </p>
            <h3>Description of experiment</h3>
            <p>
              For this experiment, I placed a plug of my bacteria in the middle
              of a petri dish and took a sample of bacteria to swab in a "T
              zone" (Refer to Day 1 of BxF pictures below). In another dish, I
              streaked the sample of bacteria to act as my control group. I then
              observed the growth of my microbe for 5 days and recorded the
              results.
            </p>
            <h3>Results</h3>
            <h3>Treatment Group 1(My microbe placed with bacteria)</h3>
            <img src="images/bf_collage.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              My microbe did not seem to stop bacteria from growing.
            </p>
            <h3>Control Group (Bacteria only)</h3>

            <img src="images/bac_collage.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              Bacteria growed on the petri dish.
            </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                My hypothesis was false, my microbe did not stop bacteria from
                growing.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the control dish, bacteria growed as expected.
              </li>
              <li>
                I can safly come to the conclusion that my fungi does not
                prevent this strain of bacteria from growing, so it does not
                have antibacterial properties against this particular type of
                bacteria. To identify its true characteristics, I would have to
                carry out additional experiments with different types of
                bacteria.
              </li>
              <li>
                Through this experiment, I have learned that my microbe, Mike
                Robe, cannot prevent this strain of bacteria from growing.
              </li>
