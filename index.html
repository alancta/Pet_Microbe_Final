                  From the first experiment we did in this class, I isolated
                  microbes from my phone screen and a leaf of my pothos plant. I learned
                  that the microbe that was present on my pothos plant was a
                  fungi. Ever since that experiment, I wanted to learn more
                  about this invisible (to the naked eye) companion that lives
                  on the surface of my pothos plant. It has a dark-green furry appearance!

                <p>
                  My topic of interest was to find what kind of environments it prefers, what
                  nutrition sources it likes, whether it can get along with a
                  bacteria, and how its effect on a piece of fruit. This was
                  mainly a test to see if it be good companions. In other words,
                  I wanted to see if it's truly a fun guy! (BA dum tss))

              From the series of experiments that I have carried out, I have learned that Mike Robe does not like extreme cold temperatures, and thrives well in a cool room temperature. It enjoyes consuming nutrients from fruits and vegetables, and thrives well when introduced to them. It does not prevent bacteria from growing. However, I cannot make a conclusion that it will stop any kind of bacteria from growing. I would have to do many other tests with different types of bacteria to tell if it has antibacterial properties. Based off the information and some research about characteristics of my fungi, if I were to make an educated guess based off my research, I think my fungi is a type of Penicillium Fungi.

              Though I have learned a lot of things about my pet microbe, Mike Robe, I think there is still a lot to learn. I took a sample from the leaf of my pothos plant, so I cannot help but wonder what kind of symbiotic relationship they have, and why it does not cause infectious symptoms or cause a disease in the plant. I would perform more tests to determine more characteristics of my fungi by placing it with different type of organic material, other types of microbes, other environments, and do more research to determine if it is actually a Penicillium Fungi.
